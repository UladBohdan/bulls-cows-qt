Realization of a popular number game "Bulls and Cows".

Application both allows you to unravel a number guessed by computer and shows how computer will manage with the same task.

The rules of the paper version are below:

>The numerical version of the game is usually played with 4 digits, but can also be played with 3 or any other number of digits.
>On a sheet of paper, the players each write a 4-digit secret number. **The digits must be all different.** Then, in turn, the players try to guess their opponent's number who gives the number of matches. If the matching digits are in their right positions, they are **bulls**, if in different positions, they are **cows**. Example:</p>
>* Secret number: 4271
>* Opponent's try: 1234
>* Answer: 1 bull and 2 cows. (The bull is "2", the cows are "4" and "1".)

>The first one to reveal the other's secret number wins the game. As the first player has a logical advantage, the game can be balanced over multiple games by alternating the right to go first, or over a single game by granting the second player an equal number of guesses, possibly resulting in a tie.
